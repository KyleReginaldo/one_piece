The World Government renamed it in an effort to erase the fruit\'s original name from history, and as a result it was reclassified as a Paramecia-type fruit that ostensibly turns the user into a Rubber Human (ゴム人間 Gomu Ningen?). The fruit was originally a treasure sought by the World Government for over 800 years, until it was stolen by Shanks and his crew in recent history. It was then accidentally eaten twelve years ago by the series\' protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy.',

The main strength of this fruit is that it transforms the user into a mythological kitsune, complete the nine large fox tails. As such, they gain all the abilities of one, including the ability to disguise themselves as anyone they like, allowing them to impersonate them. The clothing of the target person can also be imitated during the transformation. The fruit has no known weaknesses aside from the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses.',

At some point after Kaidou had partaken of the fruit, he had a sample of his Lineage Factor extracted by Vegapunk, who used it to create an artificial Devil Fruit granting the same ability, though the result was deemed a failure; said fruit was eventually consumed by Kozuki Momonosuke, who since can become a pink dragon. The fruit is spherical and slightly oblong in shape, somewhat resembling a pinecone. Its blue exterior gives the appearance of having overlapping scales: each "scale" has a small, dark-blue oval in the middle that bears a signature Devil Fruit spiral at the bottom, while the scales\' outer portions are of a lighter-blue shade. On its top, the fruit possesses orange leaves and two identical, separate stems, with one being purple and the other a lighter pink shade.',

This Devil Fruit grants the power to transform into a large phoenix shrouded in blue flames, as well as a human-phoenix hybrid at will. Notably through Marco\'s usage, no full-bodied Human-Beast Form has been seen so far, only partial morphing of his arms and legs into wings and bird legs respectively; whether said partial transformation is in fact his Human-Beast Form or not is unclear. As with all Zoans, the user\'s transformation grants them a significant boost to their overall physical abilities, bestowing in Marco\'s case strength great enough to hold back two powerful Ancient Zoan users at once. As a bird Zoan, the user is also given the ability to fly at great speed. The phoenix form (both in part and full) comes with a set of sharp talons on the feet, usable to deliver slashing damage via kicks.',

This fruit is considered "unique" even for a Logia-type, and the ability it grants is said to be the "most evil". The Yami Yami no Mi is a large, round, light purple fruit made up of many small teardrop-shaped components with swirl patterns, and green leaves sprouting from the top. Its overall shape and appearance closely resembles a pineapple or a bunch of oversized and teardrop shaped grapes. It mildly resembles the Mera Mera no Mi.',
