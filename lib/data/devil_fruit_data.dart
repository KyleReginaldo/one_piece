          'The Gomu Gomu no Mi, originally known as the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, is a Mythical Zoan-type Devil Fruit that allows the user to transform into the legendary "Sun God" Nika and gain his attributes, namely a body with the properties of rubber. The World Government renamed it in an effort to erase the fruit\'s original name from history, and as a result it was reclassified as a Paramecia-type fruit that ostensibly turns the user into a Rubber Human (ゴム人間 Gomu Ningen?). The fruit was originally a treasure sought by the World Government for over 800 years, until it was stolen by Shanks and his crew in recent history. It was then accidentally eaten twelve years ago by the series\' protagonist, Monkey D. Luffy.',
