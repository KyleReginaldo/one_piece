      description:
          'The Going Merry was the first full-sized ship owned by the Straw Hat Pirates, a caravel that served as their main transportation through the East Blue, and the Grand Line up until Water 7. It was often affectionally referred to as simply Merry (メリー Merī?) by the crew. Originally designed by Kaya\'s servant Merry, it was gifted to the Straw Hats for defending Syrup Village against the Black Cat Pirates. Over time, it came to be loved by the crew as a home and as a friend, so much so that she eventually developed a life of her own and became a genuine crew member. Unfortunately, the Going Merry took an inordinate amount of damage during her "lifetime", being blown up, impaled, sliced up multiple times, and partially eaten by Wapol. Eventually, the Merry could no longer continue and after helping the Straw Hats escape Enies Lobby, it received a Viking funeral. After its destruction, the Merry was succeeded by the Thousand Sunny, a ship specially built by Franky (and the Galley-La Company) to maintain the "soul" of its predecessor.',

          'Big Top is the Buggy Pirates\' ship. Big Top is a brightly colored ship, which imitates a circus feel. It has many circus tent designs on it, furthering Buggy\'s theme. Its figurehead is an elephant with the trunk as a cannon. The prow also has two cannons on it. The ship overall is fairly large compared to the other ships on the sea. Big Top was first seen moored on the shores of Organ Island when Buggy and his crew took over Orange Town. After Buggy was defeated by Monkey D. Luffy and sent flying off the island, the remainder of the crew took the ship and fled the island as the townspeople chased them. Soon the ship took the crew to Kumate Island, where the crew would unfortunately run into a tribe of cannibals there. Richie, who became the new captain while defeating Mohji and Cabaji in his sleep, was captured by the cannibalistic tribe and was about to be cooked when he was rescued by Buggy, who returned after an adventure of his own, bringing Alvida with him as an ally.',

The Bezan Black is a simple red and black pirate ship with a black cat as a figurehead, and a pair of ornamental cat claws on the sides. Its hull has a green base. The front part of her keel, along with the figurehead, was torn off by Luffy during his battle against the Black Cat Pirates.',

          'The Bliking is Wapol\'s ship. It has the ability to go underwater, although how this is achieved is unknown. Chess would stand on top of the mast while it was submerged, making him appear as if he were walking on water. The Bliking is a large round ship, different than most regular ships. Along with the ship\'s hippotamus/White Walkie figure head, one of the ship\'s unique features is the large steel plating around the ship, with a star like pattern. Two large gears are seen towards the side of the ship. The name is intended to be a pun as "Blik" is Dutch for \'tin plated\', while without the "bli" all that is left is "king". With this in mind, the intended name would appear to be along the lines of "Tin Plated King". Another example of such a wording would come later with Sogeking.',

          'The Flying Dutchman is the stereotypical representation of a ghost ship: old and worn from time. The sails are torn and tattered, moss and barnacles are growing out from various spots of the ship, and the mast is similar to a clock tower in design. On the bottom front sail is the name "FLYING DUTCHMAN", and the top one bears the crew\'s Jolly Roger, a fanged skull with cutlasses, their blades pointing down in place of crossbones. The ship\'s figurehead bears the same skull and swords. The Flying Dutchman is one of the largest ships to appear in the series, being as large as Wadatsumi, a sea giant who dwarfs other giant characters such as Shirahoshi. The ship is not coated with resin since the crew can survive the underwater environment due to their physiology, The vessel can also withstand the underwater pressure of 10000 feet below sea level due to already being full of holes that equalize the water pressure inside and outside the hull. Only a small portion on the deck is coated for their captain to reside in.',

The ship is only big enough for one person. At the center is a mast that resembles a large crucifix, similar to Mihawk\'s sword, with black sails and a seat for himself. Abilities. This meager craft has no apparent significance, but Mihawk was able to sail the unforgiving seas of the Grand Line on it, which is a testament to his skills.',

          'Thriller Bark is a giant ship formerly located on the Florian Triangle. As revealed by Brook, it used to be an island located in the West Blue. It was converted into a pirate ship, the world\'s largest, and is owned by the former Warlord, Gecko Moria, serving as ship for the Thriller Bark Pirates. The ship was heavily damaged by Moria\'s and Kuma\'s attacks during the battle against the Straw Hat Pirates, and, after Moria\'s defeat, was abandoned. Thriller Bark is the main setting of the Thriller Bark Arc, as well as the ninth island in Paradise that the Straw Hat Pirates visited. It seems to be later reclaimed by Moria who used it to travel to Pirate Island. The island is surrounded by a huge outer wall that goes around the ship, with a gate resembling a giant mouth that opens and closes. There are four separate chains that connect from the wall to the mast above the mansion. The island has an old broken inner stone wall encircling it with towers and a moat. There is a mansion in the middle of the island, surrounded by an apparently dead forest. The entire ship somewhat resembles the stereotypical scenery in vampire or horror movies, such as Dracula or Frankenstein.',

The Perfume Yuda was taken to the Calm Belt so Boa Hancock could meet up with Vice Admiral Momonga. Here, she refused the call of the Marines to fight in the Summit War of Marineford, before leaving and returning to Amazon Lily. After Hancock agreed to help Monkey D. Luffy to save his sworn brother, she smuggled him under her long coat while having the Perfume Yuda sail back to Momonga\'s ship.',
